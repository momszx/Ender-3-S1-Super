Introduction:
The Creality Ender 3 S1 is a popular 3D printer known for its reliability and affordability. This documentation provides instructions for upgrading the printer's stock motherboard to the Manta M4P board (available at https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M4P). The Manta M4P offers several advantages, including a web-based interface for printer control, support for interchangeable stepper motors, the option to use a separate power supply, integration with the ADXL345 accelerometer for input shaping, real-time monitoring of print progress, webcam support, and compatibility with the Klipper firmware.

Hardware Upgrades:
To perform the upgrade, you will need the following tools and components:

Manta M4P Motherboard: Obtain the Manta M4P motherboard from the official GitHub repository mentioned above. Follow the provided documentation for assembly and installation instructions.
Cables for Sprite Extruder: Order a suitable replacement cable for the sprite extruder, as the factory-provided cable may not work correctly with the Manta board. You can purchase a compatible cable from AliExpress (product link: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mLKjZ6o).
Motor and Endstop Cables: Purchase motor cables and endstop cables to connect the motors and endstop switches to the Manta board. These cables can be obtained from AliExpress as well. Here are the product links:

Additional Wiring: You will also require additional wiring to extend the bed power cable and bed temperature sensor cable. Ensure that the wires are suitable for the voltage and current requirements of your printer.
Soldering Tool: A soldering iron and solder are necessary to make electrical connections during the upgrade process.
Crimping Tool: A high-quality crimping tool is essential for securely attaching connectors to the cables.
Manta M4P Features:

Web-Based Interface: The Manta M4P board introduces a web-based control interface, allowing you to manage the printer's settings, upload G-code files, and monitor print progress remotely through a browser.
Interchangeable Stepper Motors: With the Manta M4P, you have the flexibility to use different stepper motors, enabling customization based on your printing needs.
Separate Power Supply: The Manta board supports a separate power supply for the printer's heated bed, reducing the load on the main power supply and enhancing overall stability.
ADXL345 Accelerometer Support: By integrating the ADXL345 accelerometer, the Manta board enables input shaping, reducing vibrations and improving print quality, especially during high-speed printing.
Real-Time Print Monitoring: The Manta board allows you to track the progress of your prints in real-time via the web interface, providing information such as print time, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining.
Webcam Support: With the Manta M4P, you can connect a webcam to monitor the printing process visually through the web interface, giving you added convenience and control.
Klipper Firmware Compatibility: The Manta M4P board is compatible with the Klipper firmware, which offers advanced features and superior performance compared to the stock firmware.
Please refer to the official documentation provided by Creality and the Manta M4P repository for detailed instructions on how to install and configure the Manta board in your Creality Ender 3 S1 printer. Take appropriate safety precautions while working with electrical components and ensure that you follow the manufacturer's guidelines.
